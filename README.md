<p align="left"> IdeaBlock is a blockchain-powered platform that allows any inventor or business to incontrovertibly
prove that they conceived of and publicly disclosed an idea — precluding any other individual or
business from later protecting the idea for themselves — at a fraction of the cost of other traditional
vehicles for IP protection.</p>

## Thank You

First of all, we would like to thank you for your interest in the initial beta release of IdeaBlock!  We hope that you enjoy your experience with the application and look forward to receiving your feedback.  

We encourage you to submit as many issues as you would like that detail anything good and (especially) the not-so-good (yes, please tell us!) about your experience.  Our current timeline has a firm goal of late August for our first public non-beta release, so any features we can add or aspects that we can tweak during beta will go a long way in ensuring the success of our public release. Don't be shy!

You are essential to the long-term success of our business - we cannot thank you enough for taking the time to use IdeaBlock Beta and appreciate you taking the time out of your day to provide feedback to us to help us improve the application for everyone going forward.  Our users ARE IdeaBlock and we hope to have you as a user forever!

## How to Provide Feedback

For our beta period, we will be utilizing both [email](mailto:feedback@ideablock.io) and GitHub's issue-reporting feature to allow our beta users to submit feedback.

**To submit feedback on GitHub:**

1.  [Navigate to the Issues tab above](https://github.com/emsheets/patentshell/issues)
2.  Click the "New Issue" button
3.  Sign up/Log In with GitHub (if necessary)
4.  Provide your feedback (Feel free to add screenshots!)
5.  Click the "Submit new issue" button
6.  Share IdeaBlock on your social media accounts! (optional)

## Disclaimer

Please take time to carefully read the [Terms and Conditions](https://beta.ideablock.io/terms) associated with use of IdeaBlock Beta when you register.  In particular, please know that at the current release utilizes Bitcoin and Litecoin testnets, which are subject to change.  Therefore, though your ideas are tethered to these public blockchains, their immutability is not fully guaranteed (for instance the Bitcoin blockchain has undergone three hard forks and comes with no ultimate promise of long-term support or availability).  We will be moving the application to mainnet in the coming days and will announce the move publicly, so stay tuned!  In the meantime, we hope you will test the application by uploading sample ideas that are already in the public domain or for which you will not seek subsequent protection (as uploading them to the current release could potentially be interpreted as surrender to the public domain).
